                    <p> Hussaina is from India and she's 18 years old. She is a massive book worm and reads books like she breathes. Her favourite way to enjoy a day would be a cozy spot with good lighting, a nice snack and her book. She can speak 4 languages fluently and can read and write a fifth one. She has been into coding since she was 13 years old and has given as chance to multiple languages and decided to pursue a career in this field because she enjoys it. The thrill of making something from scratch, basically she thinks of her projects as her children and that as you can see is a beautiful relationship in her view.  </p>
