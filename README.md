As our first year final assignment in the Client Side Web Development module we had to build a fully functional website. 
It was a group assignment and we chose to build a website for Porsche. 
As all of us were very new to coding, we were only using GitLab which was also a part of our first year curriculum.
I'm publishing our code here to get comfortable with github.
My contributionto the website:
 - About Authors Page
 - Models Page
 - About Us Page.
